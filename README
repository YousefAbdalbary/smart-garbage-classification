# 📘 Smart Garbage Classification using EfficientNetV2-S

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **deep learning-based garbage classification system** using **EfficientNetV2-S pretrained on ImageNet** and fine-tuned on a real-world garbage image dataset.

The model classifies images into 6 categories:

* Cardboard
* Glass
* Metal
* Paper
* Plastic
* Trash

## 📂 Dataset

📥 Kaggle Dataset:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification)

The dataset contains labeled images of garbage categorized into 6 classes.

### Class Distribution:

| Class     | Samples |
| --------- | ------- |
| Cardboard | 403     |
| Glass     | 501     |
| Metal     | 410     |
| Paper     | 594     |
| Plastic   | 482     |
| Trash     | 137     |

⚠️ The dataset is imbalanced (Trash has fewer samples), so class weights were applied during training.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### EfficientNetV2-S

* Pretrained on ImageNet (1.2M images)
* Lightweight yet powerful
* Improved training efficiency over original EfficientNet
* Better generalization with fewer parameters

```python
from torchvision.models import efficientnet_v2_s

model = efficientnet_v2_s(weights="IMAGENET1K_V1")
```

The final classification layer was replaced to match 6 output classes.
